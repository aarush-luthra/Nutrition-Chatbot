## 🟢 Case 1: Weight Loss & PCOS Management
**User Profile:** 28-year-old Female | 160cm | 75kg (BMI: 29.3) | Goal: Weight Loss | Condition: PCOS | Diet: Vegetarian

### Scenario: Asking for a PCOS-friendly lunch
**User:** "I'm feeling really hungry and want something filling for lunch, but I need to be careful because of my PCOS. What should I eat?"

**Fit Buddy's Approach:**
*   Identifies the user's weight loss goal and PCOS condition.
*   Recommends low-glycemic, high-fiber Indian options.
*   Provides a supportive, encouraging tone.

**Expected Response:**
> "For PCOS and weight loss, we want to keep your blood sugar stable while keeping you full! 🥗 A great option would be a **Moong Dal Chilla** with lots of veggies or **Oats Khichdi** with a side of cucumber raita. These are high in fiber and protein which helps with insulin sensitivity. Would you like a quick recipe for the Chilla? 😊"

## 🔵 Case 2: Muscle Building for Vegetarians
**User Profile:** 24-year-old Male | 180cm | 70kg (BMI: 21.6) | Goal: Build Muscle | Diet: Eggetarian

### Scenario: Post-workout protein needs
**User:** "Just finished a heavy chest workout! 💪 What should I eat now to build muscle? I eat eggs but no meat."

**Fit Buddy's Approach:**
*   Recognizes the BMI is on the lower side and the goal is muscle gain.
*   Focuses on protein-dense "Eggetarian" options.
*   Uses enthusiastic "Fitness Buddy" tone.

**Expected Response:**
> "Great job on the workout! 🔥 To build those muscles, aim for protein + carbs right now. Since you eat eggs, **3-4 Egg Whites with Whole Wheat Toast** or a **Paneer Bhurji** with a small roti would be perfect! 🥚 These provide the amino acids your muscles need to recover and grow. Keep it up! [CALORIES: 350]"

## 🟠 Case 3: Managing Hypertension (Senior User)
**User Profile:** 55-year-old Male | 172cm | 85kg (BMI: 28.7) | Goal: Manage Health | Condition: Hypertension | Diet: Non-Vegetarian

### Scenario: Making breakfast healthier
**User:** "Is Poha okay for breakfast? I have high blood pressure so I'm trying to be careful."

**Fit Buddy's Approach:**
*   Focuses on low-sodium tips and weight management.
*   Suggests simple modifications to a staple Indian breakfast.
*   Maintains a respectful, caring tone.

**Expected Response:**
> "Poha is a lovely choice, but for hypertension, we should make a few tweaks! 🥣 Try to use less salt and add plenty of vegetables like peas, carrots, and beans to increase the fiber. Also, avoid adding 'Sev' or salty namkeen on top. Adding a squeeze of lemon will give it great flavor without the extra sodium! 🍋 [CALORIES: 270]"
